This contains a presentation in [`present` format](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present).

*The slides doesn't work with the official present tool*.
Actually, there is an embedded demo within the slides that requires some tweaking (on top of the mathjax library that is required for the slides).

The tool is included here, and to run the demo you need to run 

`go run *go -orighost localhost` from this directory.
